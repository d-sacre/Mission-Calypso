              <h1>Help: How to use the gui </h1>
                  The main userinterface is hidden per default. Only the headup-gui is visible
                  all the time. By clicking on the headup-gui or the top of the menu rocket visible at
                  the bottom of the screen, the game menu will slide up. To hide the settings, simply click
                  again.

              <h1>Getting started</h1>
                  <h3>First steps </h3>
                      To achieve the game's task, you need to get a central mining tunnel
                      for the workers. Otherwise it is impossible to mine the resources. Take
                      a good look at the map and decide, where it is most rewarding to mine. Then
                      open the game menu and select with the slider placed in the fieldset "main drill depth"
                      the desired drilling depth. Confirm your choice by clicking on the "Start main drill!" button.
                      The drill will start working; the progress will be displayed in the fieldset.
                      </br>
                      As soon as the first blocks are removed, the destination for the worker can be set by simply hiding
                      the menu and clicking on the desired block that should be removed. If your choice is not yet reachable
                      by a horizontal tunnel, don't worry, the miner will remove all blocks between himself and the destination.
                      </br>
                      If you feel the need, you can always go deeper if necessecary (up until you reach the main drill limit).
