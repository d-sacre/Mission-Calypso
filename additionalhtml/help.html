              <h1>Help: How to use the gui </h1>
                  The main userinterface is hidden per default. Only the headup-gui is visible
                  all the time. By clicking on the headup-gui or the top of the menu rocket visible at
                  the bottom of the screen, the game menu will slide up. To hide the settings, simply click
                  again. The clickable areas are marked in the picture below.

              <h1>Getting started</h1>
                  <h3>First steps </h3>
                      To achieve the game's task, you need to get a central mining tunnel
                      for the workers. Otherwise it is impossible to mine the resources. Take
                      a good look at the map and decide, where it is most rewarding to mine. Then
                      open the game menu and select with the slider placed in the fieldset "main drill depth"
                      the desired drilling depth. Confirm your choice by clicking on the "Start main drill!" button.
                      The drill will start working; the progress will be displayed in the fieldset.
                      </br>
                      As soon as the first blocks are removed, the destination for the worker can be set by simply hiding
                      the menu and clicking on the desired block that should be removed. If your choice is not yet reachable
                      by a horizontal tunnel, don't worry, the miner will remove all blocks between himself and the destination.
                      </br>
                      If you feel the need, you can always go deeper if necessecary (up until you reach the main drill limit).

                  <h3>A short introduction to the resource system</h3>
											<p>
													The basic principle of the game is very simple: Everything consumes resources. The player's task is yet to minimize
													the consumption, but still being able to mine 15 t of copper ore and – if possible – refine it to copper ingots.
										  </p>

											<p>
													Your main constraints are:
													<ul>
															<li>
																	Keep the energy above 50 HU,
															</li>
															<li>
																	Keep the CO<sub>2</sub> below 8 %,
															</li>
													</ul>
													or the game is over. You can do so if you mine the minerals and refine them. The green Caloricum crystals
													can be processed to energy, the blue and gray pottasium ore can be turned into decarbonizers. Each used kilogram of
													Decarbonizers reduces the CO<sub>2</sub> by 2 %. You need to use it strategically: You only reduce CO<sub>2</sub>,
													but you do not regain O<sub>2</sub>! On the long run, you can not prevent the O<sub>2</sub> concentration
													to drop under 10.5 % which will also end the game. Treat the decarbonizers as a way to maintain productivity
													and not as a method to prolong the game drastically by all means. Strategic decisions are needed to win the game, not brute force!
